 # Frontend Mentor - QR code component

![Design preview for the QR code component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is my first Frontend Mentor Coding Challenge.

It is a good challenge to practice my HTML and CSS skills. However, It took me awhile to understand how it works but with perseverance, I quickly grasped its mechanics and completed the challenge in under 30 minutes.

Creating a QR-Code component using HTML and CSS was fun and engaing.

Thank you Frontend Mentor.
